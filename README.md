<h1><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44b.png?v8" width="30"/> Hey There! Nice to see you.</h1>

I'm Yogesh from <b>Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India</b> <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f1ee-1f1f3.png?v8" width="13"/>, a seasoned front-end developer with 7+ years of experience in building dynamic and responsive web applications. My core expertise lies in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on modern frameworks like React and Next.js. I excel in crafting intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, leveraging component-based architecture, state management, and performance optimization to deliver seamless web experiences.

In addition to my front-end expertise, I have basic knowledge of back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, along with a foundational understanding of PHP and MySQL. My primary focus is on front-end development, where I create engaging user experiences, but I also actively expand my knowledge of back-end technologies to enhance my versatility and contribute more effectively in full-stack projects when needed.
